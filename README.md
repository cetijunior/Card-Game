# Project Description

## Card Game Application

This project is a full-stack web application for a multiplayer card game, built with modern web technologies. The application consists of a client-side React application and a server-side Node.js application using Express and Socket.io for real-time communication.

### Client-Side

The client-side application is built using React and Vite for a fast development experience. It includes the following features:

- **User Interface**: A responsive and interactive UI built with React components.
- **Routing**: Client-side routing using React Router for seamless navigation between different pages.
- **State Management**: Local state management using React hooks.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and PostCSS for processing CSS.
- **Game Logic**: Core game logic implemented in JavaScript, including poker game rules and score management.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Real-time multiplayer functionality using Socket.io to communicate with the server.

### Server-Side

The server-side application is built using Node.js and Express, providing the following features:

- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time communication with clients using Socket.io.
- **Game State Management**: Server-side management of game state and player interactions.
- **Routing**: Basic routing for API endpoints using Express.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories: [``client``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FUser%2FDesktop%2FCode%2Fcard-game%2Fclient%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\User\Desktop\Code\card-game\client") and [``server``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FUser%2FDesktop%2FCode%2Fcard-game%2Fserver%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\User\Desktop\Code\card-game\server").

- **Client**: Contains the React application.
  - `src/`: Source code for the React application.
    - `components/`: Reusable React components.
    - `logic/`: Game logic and utility functions.
    - [`pages/`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FUser%2FDesktop%2FCode%2Fcard-game%2Fclient%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FUsernameInput.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "client/src/pages/UsernameInput.jsx"): Page components for different routes.
  - `public/`: Static assets such as images and icons.
  - Configuration files for Vite, Tailwind CSS, and PostCSS.

- **Server**: Contains the Node.js server application.
  - `server.js`: Main server file.
  - Configuration files for dependencies and environment settings.

### Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the [``client``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FUser%2FDesktop%2FCode%2Fcard-game%2Fclient%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\User\Desktop\Code\card-game\client") and [``server``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FUser%2FDesktop%2FCode%2Fcard-game%2Fserver%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\User\Desktop\Code\card-game\server") directories and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

2. **Run the Development Server**:
   - In the [``client``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FUser%2FDesktop%2FCode%2Fcard-game%2Fclient%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\User\Desktop\Code\card-game\client") directory, run `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server.
   - In the [``server``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FUser%2FDesktop%2FCode%2Fcard-game%2Fserver%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\User\Desktop\Code\card-game\server") directory, run `npm start` to start the Node.js server.

3. **Open the Application**:
